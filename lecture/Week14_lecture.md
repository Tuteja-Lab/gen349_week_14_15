## Introduction to UNIX
### What is UNIX?
- A common operating system.
- What is an operating system?
    - An operating system is the suite of programs that make the computer work.
- The UNIX operating system is made up of the kernel, the shell, and the programs.
    - The **kernel** is the hub of the operating system. It allocates time and memory to programs.
    - The **shell** is the interface between the user and a kernel. It is a **command line** interpreter.
    - Shell commands can be run in the **terminal**.

### UNIX based operating systems	
**Linux**

* Operating system and bundled application programs.
* Derived from Unix.
* Linux is free (open source).
* Linux is stable.
* Linux systems are highly customizable.
**Computing clusters are all Linux based.**

**MacOSX**

* More user friendly for beginners.

### UNIX is useful in bioinformatics...

- when you are trying to open a large FASTQ file.
- when you are searching for specific information from a large number of files.
- when you want to rename a large number of files.
- when you want to combine a large number of files into one file.
- when you need to run a program that is not available on Galaxy, and can only run in a UNIX-based environment.
- when you want to automate repetitive tasks.

## Accessing HPC class and some notes
* Now we will connect to the HPC class for today's tutorial.
* If this is your first time accessing the HPC, please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/Tuteja-Lab/gen349_week_14_15/blob/main/installation.md).
* If this is NOT your first time accessing the HPC, continue following the steps listed on this page. 
	* <u>**Make sure to always follow these steps when working on class material.**</u>
	
	* Below are the commands you should use to paste the commands into PowerShell, Putty, and Mac:
		* PowerShell: `Ctrl + V`
		* Putty: `Right click`
		* Mac Terminal: `Command + V`
	

### Step 1: Connect to ISU Wifi or VPN (if off campus)

* Note an ISU guest Wifi will not work. For example: IASTATE-Guest

### Step 2: Connect to Nova

**Windows version >= 10:**

* Copy and paste the command below into PowerShell. Be sure to replace `your-net-id` with your own NetID:

	```
	ssh your-net-id@nova.its.iastate.edu
	```

**Windows version < 10:**

* If you are using Putty, put the information as in the picture here. Replace `hhvu` with your own NetID.:
	
	<img src="/images/hpc-class.PNG" width="360" height="350" />

**MacOSX:**

* Open the Terminal and copy and paste the command below and replace `your-net-id` with your own NetID:

	```
	ssh your-net-id@nova.its.iastate.edu
	```

#### Step 2a: Enter Verification code

* Type the google authenticator (GA) code from the app on your device when "Verification code:" is prompted.
	* Note: No characters will show in the terminal while you are typing. 

<img src="/images/verify.PNG" width="490" height="125" />

#### Step 2b: Enter your Net ID password.

* Note: No characters will show in the terminal while you are typing your password.

### Step 3: Request interactive access to a compute node in instruction partition

* Check which class you are registered for:

	* If you are registered for GEN 3490, then you should copy and paste the following command to your terminal:
	```
	salloc --partition=instruction -N 1 -n 4 -t 3:00:00 --account=s2025.gen.349.1
	```
	* If you are registered for BIOL 3490, then you should copy and paste the following command to your terminal:
	```
	salloc --partition=instruction -N 1 -n 4 -t 3:00:00 --account=s2025.biol.349.1
	```

* Once the partition is granted, it will prompt some messages similar to the following:

<img src="/images/class-partition.PNG" width="950" height="110" />


## Cloning the GitHub Repository
Copy and Paste the commands below to your terminal.

- Navigate to the `classtmp/` directory:


	```cd /work/classtmp/GEN349_S2025/```

- Make a directory named with your ISU NetID. **Note:** Replace `krkies` with your ISU NetID:

	```mkdir krkies``` 

- Navigate into your new directory: 
	```cd krkies/```

- Clone the GitHub repository for today's class:

    ```git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/Tuteja-Lab/gen349_week_14_15.git```


## Things to Remember!
### Tips

* Use the commands below to **paste** a command **into** PowerShell/Putty/Mac:
	* PowerShell: `Ctrl + V`
	* Putty: `Right click`
	* Mac Terminal: `Command + V`
* Use the commands below to **copy** text **from**  PowerShell/Putty/Mac into a different location:
	* PowerShell: highlight the text and then hit  `Ctrl + C`
	* Putty: highlight the text to automaticall copy the text to Putty's clipboard.
	* Mac Terminal: highlight the text and then hit `Command + C`

- Attention to detail is important.
    - Capitalization matters.
    - Spaces matter.
    - Semi colon, commas matter.
- Donâ€™t try to rush through everything.
- If you get overwhelmed, take a deep breath and try again. You got this!

### If you have questions:
- Let us know if we need to slow down.
- If you move faster than us, wait to ask your question until we get to the part you are on.

## General structure of a command in Unix

`program [-flags] argument1 argument2 ...`

- For example:
    `echo hello world`
    
| Term | Definition | Example |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  program | the name (case sensitive) of the program  | echo |
|  argument | additional information you give the program to get it to do what you want it to do.  | hello world |    

- Flags = options to run the program. Flags start with a single dash `-` or two dashes `--`, and change the behavior of a command.


## Navigating Directories

- A **directory** is similar to a folder that can hold files on your computer.
- Directories are organzied in a hierarchy. 

### pwd
- `pwd` = print working directory.
- Tells you where you are sitting in the directory tree.
- Whenever you start up a terminal, you will start in a special directory called the `home` directory. Every user has their own home directory where they have full access to do whatever they want.

### ls
- `ls` = list the files in the current directory.
- A flag can be added to `ls` to list the files in different ways.
- For example, we can add the `-l` flag to list all of the files in the current directory using a long listing format
	- Try it out: `ls -l`
   
    
- To explore all options to run `ls`, type `man ls`.
- Within the `man` page, use arrow keys to move up/down/left/right. To quit the `man` page, hit `q`.

### cd
- `cd` = change directory.
- Helps you navigate between different directories.


### Quick check:
* Now, let's navigate to the directory `lecture` replacing replace `krkies` with your NetID: `cd /work/classtmp/GEN349_S2025/krkies/gen349_week_14_15/lecture` 
* Recheck where you are: `pwd`
* Check what is in the directory: `ls`

### Root vs home directory
- Root = the first or top-most directory in a hierarchy. Sometimes you won't have full access in `root`, e.g., when you are on university's high performance clusters.
- `home` directory is under the root.

<img src="/images/absolutePathNames.jpg"/>
Adapted from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/absolute-relative-pathnames-unix/

### Relative vs. absolute path
- Where you are in the directory tree is called your **path**.
- In a path name, different directories and file names are separated by a slash `/`. The root has no name, so it's only one slash `/`.
    - For example:
    
	    ```
	    cd / 
	    pwd
	    ls #check what is in the root directory
	    ```
	    
	 	* Note: Command line will not recognize comments beginning with #. These are used for documentation.

    
    
- A path is either **relative** or **absolute**:
    - An **absolute** path = the root element and the complete directory list. An absolute path always starts with `/`.
    	* An example of an absolute path is `/work/classtmp/GEN349_S2025/krkies/gen349_week_14_15/` (shown below in blue)
    	
    - A **relative** path needs to be combined with another path in order to access a file.
    	* An example of a relative path is`gen349_week_14_15/lecture` (circled in red)

<img src="/images/pathExample.png" width="750" height="400"/>

- The current directory is denoted by `.`.
- The parent directory is denoted by `..`.

- When we do `cd ..`, this will put us one directory above where we were.
- When we do `cd`, this will put us back to the `home` directory.

#### Question time!

* There's a directory called `hearingData` under the directory `lecture`.

1. How would you go to the directory if you are currently in the `gen349_week_14_15` directory?
2. How would you go to the directory regardless of your current location?
3. Which files listed below are in the `hearingData` directory?
    <p> A. Data8355, Data7493, Data1235 <p>
    <p> B. Data0335, Data0492, Data0225 </p>


## Creating and Destroying files
| Command | Description |
|:-:|:-:|
|mkdir| makes a directory|
|rmdir| removes an empty directory|
|touch <nameOfFile>| creates an file|
|rm <nameOfFile> | removes a file|
|rm -r <directory> | removes an entire directory and all of its contents|
|cp <filename> <destination>| copy a file to a location|
|mv <filename> <destination>| moves a file to a location|
    
For example:

```
mkdir testdir
cd testdir
touch testfile.txt
ls
cd ../
rm testdir
```

You cannot `rm testdir` here. Why?

### `rm -r` 

* `rm -r` will remove non-empty directories and all the files within them. 
* For example:

	```
	rm -r testdir
	ls
	```

* Make sure you ALWAYS know what you are deleting BEFORE you delete it!  
* `rm -r` HAS GIVEN ME NIGHTMARES. BE CAREFUL! 

## Shortcuts
   
### Wild card
- The `*` character matches against any set of characters.
- For example, the following command list all the files in our current directory that contain "md" at the end of the file names:
    `ls *md`
- If there is no file with the name pattern `*md` in the directory, it will throw an error `ls: cannot access *md: No such file or directory`.

	#### Question time!
	* Make sure you are in the `gen349_week_14_15` directory.
	* Then, do this command: `ls lecture/hearingData/Data*4*2`.
	* What do you observe from the patterns of the file names?


### Tab Completion
- Navigate to your `classtmp/` directory (in the command below, replace `krkies` with your ISU Net ID)

	``` cd /work/classtmp/GEN349_S2025/krkies```

- Typing out directory names can waste a lot of time. When you start typing out the name of a directory, then hit the "tab" key, the shell will try to fill in the rest of the directory name. For example, enter:

    `cd g<tab>`
    
- The shell will fill in the rest of the directory name for `gen349_week_14_15`. Once you change directories, enter:

    `ls lecture/Diverse<tab><tab>`
    
- When you hit the first tab, nothing happens. The reason is that there are multiple files in the `lecture` directory which start with `Diverse`. Thus, the shell does not know which one to fill in. When you hit tab again, the shell will list the possible choices.
- Tab completion can also fill in the names of programs. For example, enter `e<tab><tab>`. You will see the name of every program that starts with an `e`. One of those is `echo`. To quit out of the program list, hit `q`.
- If you enter `ec<tab>` you will see that tab completion works immediately, because there is only one program name starting with `ec`.

### clear

* Sometimes your terminal is filled with past commands/outputs, and you want to have a clean terminal to avoid confusion. Then, you can do: `clear` or hit `Ctrl + l`.

* You can use the up arrow key to see past commands/outputs.

## Quick check:
* If I want to go to the directory `lecture` but I don't know where I am now, what should I do?
* Let's go to the directory `lecture`!
	* If you are not sure how to get there from your current directory you can always use this command (but replace `krkies` with your ISU Net ID):

		```
		cd /work/classtmp/GEN349_S2025/krkies/gen349_week_14_15/lecture/
		```
    
## Examining files on the command line
### cat
- `cat` = concatenate.
- Displays contents of file on screen.
    - For example (from the `lecture` directory): `cat fileA.bed`
        
    - This will display the entire file at once. It will look overwhelming if you have a big file!
- If you put two file names, it will display the first file, followed by the 2nd file.
	- For example: `cat fileA.bed fileB.bed`

### less
- `less` lets you open the file and navigate through it.
	- For example: `less DiverseCas9s.faa `

- Use "space" to go forward and hit the "b" key to go backwards.
- The "g" key goes to the beginning of the file and "G" (i.e., `shift + G`) goes to the end.
- Finally, hit `q` to quit.

### head
- `head` writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen.
- To change the number of lines printed, type `head -n <number> <file name>`.
- Let's try an example:
	- First, make sure you are still in the directory `lecture`.
	- Next, enter the command: `head -n 5 DiverseCas9s.faa`

### tail
- `tail` writes the last ten lines of a file to the screen.
- To change the number of lines printed, type `tail -n <number> <file name>`.
- For example: `tail -n 5 DiverseCas9s.faa`
    
### grep
- `grep` can search files for specific words or patterns.
- For example:
    `grep "locus" DiverseCas9s.faa`
- To explore other options, `man grep` or `grep -h` or `grep --help`
    
### sort
- `sort` provides different options to sort a file.
- For example: `sort DiverseCas9s-names.txt` will sort the file `DiverseCas9s-names.txt` alphabetically based on the first column.
- If your file has multiple columns, you can use `-k` and the column number to sort by another column than the first (default).
- For more options in `sort`, type `man sort` or `sort --help` (`-h` may not work in this case). Reminder: to exit the `man` page when doing `man sort`, hit `q`.
- Note: `sort -n` will compare according to numerical value, but it cannot understand the value of scientific notation such as `6E+10`.

    
	#### Question time!
	1. Read through the `man` page of `sort`. If I want to sort something in  **reverse** order, what `-flag` should I use?
	    <p> A. `-b` </p> 
	    <p> B. `-i` </p>
	    <p> C. `-r` </p>
	    <p> D. `-n` </p>
	

### uniq
- `uniq` can be used to identify lines that occur uniquely in a file (`-u`), lines that are duplicated in a file (`-d`), or to count the number of occurrences in a file (`-c`)
-  Files must be sorted before running this command.
-  Without any options, the result is the same as using `sort -u` (which only keeps unique entries).


### cut
- `cut` can be used to print only selected columns from a file.
- Examples:
    - Print column 1 of `DiverseCas9s-names.txt`, do `cut -f 1 DiverseCas9s-names.txt`.
    - Print column 1 and 3 from `DiverseCas9s-names.txt`, do `cut -f 1,3 DiverseCas9s-names.txt` (no space between `1,` and `3`).
- To explore other options, do `cut --help`.


### wc
- `wc` will print newline, word, and byte counts for each file.
- Do `man wc` to find out all options in `wc`.
- For example, if you want to count the number of lines in a file:

    `wc -l DiverseCas9s.faa`
    
	#### Question time!
	1. If I want to count the number of words in a file, what `-flag` should I use?
	2. How many words are there in the file `hearingData/Data0526`?

### Redirect data `>` to a file
- The following command prints the output on the screen.

    `grep "gbkey=CDS" DiverseCas9s.faa`

- What if you want to store the output to another file?

    `grep "locus_tag=STER" DiverseCas9s.faa > Cas9sOutput.txt`

### Append data `>>`to a file
- What if you want to add the search results to your output file that already exists?

    `grep 'protein_id=YP' DiverseCas9s.faa >> Cas9sOutput.txt`

- If you only used the `>` the text that was already in the file would be overwritten.

### Pipe `|`
- The `|` command (hit `Shift + \`) allows you to connect the output of one command to the next command.
- Save time and memory when programming!
- For example:
    `grep 'protein_id=YP' DiverseCas9s.faa | wc -l`
	- In this command, we search for every line that has the pattern `protein_id=YP` in the file `DiverseCas9s.faa`.
	- This output is then piped directly to the command `wc -l` to immediately count the number lines within `DiverseCas9s.faa` that match the pattern `protein_id=YP`.

## Conclusion
- The ability to use and navigate with UNIX is essential.
- Our best friends: Google, `man`, or `<program name> --help`.
